# II.	Sale Trends Analysis
 
Daily sales in 2015 showed considerable variation, with notable peaks exceeding $4,300 in October and November and a low of $1,200 in March. This fluctuation suggests that daily stock and preparation levels could be dynamically adjusted to meet varying customer demand, informed by the average daily sales of $2,200.
Weekly sales across 2015 generally fluctuated around $16,000, with a notable decline in week 39 and a strong surge to a peak of $19,756 in week 48. The first and last weeks of the year exhibited the lowest sales figures, at $7,244 and $9,863, respectively, likely due to New Year's holiday meal planning. The observed drop in sales around week 39 presents an opportunity for targeted sales boosts and promotional activities.
With the highest sales occurring in July at over $72.5k, monthly sales in 2015 exhibited an alternating pattern of increases and decreases. The lowest sales were recorded in both September and October, at around $64k. The alternating up-and-down pattern of monthly sales, with a peak in July and a trough in September/October, suggests potential seasonal influences on pizza demand. July's high sales could be attributed to warmer weather or summer, perhaps leading to increased social gatherings and outdoor events where pizza is a popular choice. Conversely, the lower sales in September and October might reflect a return to school routines, changing weather patterns, or a shift in consumer spending habits after the summer months. 
Sales clearly trend upwards towards the weekend, with Friday ($136k) being the highest sales day, followed by Thursday and Saturday. Sunday ($99k), while still a respectable sales day, is notably lower than the peak weekend days. The pattern strongly indicates that weekend periods are key drivers of pizza sales. It is logical to concentrate resources during these peak periods. This includes strategically allocating staff, optimizing stock levels to meet the increased demand, and potentially focusing marketing efforts to capitalize on this weekend surge in customer activity.
Daily sales exhibit a strong correlation with meal times. Revenue is minimal between 9 and 10 am ($83), followed by a dramatic increase leading to a peak at 12 pm ($111,877) and a slightly lower peak at 1 pm. Afternoon sales decline, but then rise again to a local peak of $89,000 at 6 pm, corresponding to typical dinner hours. A gradual decline follows, with sales ceasing at 11 pm. This pattern clearly demonstrates the influence of both meal periods and operating hours on pizza demand.
# III.	Product Performance Analysis
 
The rankings reveal some interesting findings between quantity sold and revenue generated:
-	**Classic Pizzas:** Dominate both in terms of quantity sold and revenue with such great gaps, suggesting they are the most popular and contribute the most to the bottom line. This isn't surprising, as "classic" often refers to core, traditional offerings, which helps bring the brands to the customers.
-	**Supreme Pizzas:** Also perform strongly in both categories, ranking second in quantity and revenue. This indicates a good balance of popularity and profitability.
-	**Chicken Pizzas:** Show a noticeable difference in ranking. While they are the third most popular in terms of quantity, they generate the least revenue. This suggests a potentially lower price point or smaller portion sizes for chicken pizzas.
-	**Veggie Pizzas:** Present the most significant difference. They rank fourth in quantity sold but third in revenue generated, surpassing chicken pizzas. This implies that veggie pizzas, while not as frequently ordered, may have a higher price point or larger portion sizes than chicken pizzas, contributing more to overall revenue despite lower sales volume.
The dominance of classic and supreme pizzas suggests that these categories are core offerings and should be maintained and potentially promoted. Understanding what makes these pizzas so popular can inform the development of new menu items. There might be an opportunity to increase the sales volume of veggie pizzas. Targeted marketing campaigns could highlight the value proposition of veggie pizzas, emphasizing their higher revenue contribution per unit. 
     
The ranking for the most and least popular pizzas witness remarkable patterns. While the Classic pizzas (Deluxe, Hawaiian, Pepperoni) sell the most, the Chicken generates more revenue due to their higher margins. The top 5 popular pizzas contribute more than 20% in total quantity sold and 25% of the total sales. The vegetarian pizzas are the least popular ones, especially Brie Carre with only 490 in quantity sold, generating $11.5k throughout the year. This strengthens the case for reviewing these menu items. They might be candidates for removal.

# IV.	Size and Ingredient Analysis
 
The relationship between pizza size and sales volume reveals distinct customer preferences across different pizza categories. For Supreme, Veggie, and Chicken pizzas, a clear trend emerges: customers favor larger sizes, with sales increasing from Small to Medium to Large. Interestingly, these categories do not offer XL or XXL sizes, suggesting that customers ordering these varieties are less inclined towards very large pizzas. The absence of larger sizes for Supreme, Veggie, and Chicken pizzas could indicate that customers ordering these varieties are more conscious of portion control or simply prefer standard sizes for these flavor profiles.
In contrast, the Classic pizza category exhibits a different pattern. Small pizzas are exceptionally popular, significantly outselling Medium and Large sizes. While XL and XXL sizes are available for Classic pizzas, their sales are relatively low. This difference in sizing preferences may reflect customer perceptions of "classic" flavors as a safer choice. Customers might feel more comfortable ordering a larger quantity of a familiar, traditional pizza. 

  
The analysis of ingredient popularity, based on both frequency and quantity sold, reveals distinct preferences within each pizza category, with near-identical results between the two metrics. This similarity is likely due to the fact that 96.36% of orders consist of single-quantity pizzas, meaning each order contributes almost equally to both frequency and quantity counts. Specifically, for Veggie pizzas, Garlic is the most popular ingredient, while Kalamata Olives and Plum Tomatoes are least favored. In Supreme pizzas, Garlic is also most popular, with Brie Carre Cheese, Prosciutto, Caramelized Onions, Pears, and Thyme least favored. Pepperoni dominates Classic pizzas, while Green Peppers are least popular. Finally, Red Peppers are most popular in Chicken pizzas, while Pesto Sauce is least favored. These findings offer valuable insights into customer preferences, informing ingredient purchasing, and new pizza development.
# V.	Order and Ingredient Correlations
 
The analysis reveals a strong positive correlation (0.999) between total quantity sold and revenue, indicating a highly effective sales strategy where increased sales volume directly translates to higher revenue. Segmentation of the data, using average quantity (4195) and revenue ($70k) as benchmarks, further highlights product performance. Notably, garlic is associated with both high sales volume and revenue, suggesting its popularity and contribution to profits. Conversely, pizzas containing bacon exhibit high sales volume but comparatively lower revenue. The remaining products generally adhere to the expected pattern of high quantity/high revenue and low quantity/low revenue.
Based on these findings, a thorough analysis of bacon-containing products is recommended to understand the discrepancy between sales volume and revenue. Furthermore, products in the low-performing quadrant should be evaluated for potential adjustments in pricing, marketing to improve their contribution to overall revenue. 

    
The analysis reveals significant variations in the relationship between pizza prices and sales volume across different categories. Chicken pizzas exhibit an unusually strong positive correlation (0.991), suggesting that higher prices are associated with increased sales, potentially driven by high demand for specific variations, effective marketing, or a recognized premium quality. 
On the flipped side, veggie and supreme pizzas show near-zero correlations, indicating that price has minimal influence on customer purchasing habits in these categories. Classic pizzas, however, demonstrate a weak negative correlation (-0278), aligning with the expected price sensitivity of customers in this segment, where higher prices tend to result in slightly lower sales volumes. 

# VI.	Order Frequency and Timing
In terms of orders, multi-item orders significantly outnumber single-item ones. Specifically, multi-item orders account for approximately 61.59% of all orders (13,150 orders), while single-item orders represent about 38.41% (8,200 orders). This indicates a clear preference among customers for purchasing multiple items in a single transaction.
The analysis of order time intervals reveals that the average time between orders (within the same day) is 10.83 minutes. The longest interval between any two orders is 139 minutes, while the minimum interval between orders is 0 minutes, indicating that some orders were placed consecutively.
These findings provide insight into the frequency of order placement. The average interval indicates a relatively consistent flow of orders, while the maximum and minimum intervals highlight the variability in order timing.

# VII.	Conclusion and Recommendations
This comprehensive analysis of pizza manufacturing and ordering data for 2015 reveals a successful year, characterized by strong revenue and sales volume, driven primarily by classic and supreme pizzas. The business demonstrates a clear understanding of customer preferences, particularly regarding pizza sizes and ingredients. Sales trends highlight the influence of seasonal factors, holiday periods, weekend demand, and meal times, providing valuable insights for operational adjustments. The strong positive correlation between sales volume and revenue underscores the effectiveness of current sales strategies. However, discrepancies in revenue generation, such as the poor performance of certain vegetarian options, necessitate further investigation and strategic adjustments.

Recommendations:

**1.	Optimize Product Portfolio:**
-	Capitalize on the popularity of classic and supreme pizzas by maintaining high standards and potentially introducing new variations.
-	Conduct a thorough review of chicken and bacon-containing pizza pricing and portion sizes to address revenue discrepancies.
-	Evaluate and potentially revise or remove low-performing vegetarian pizzas, such as Brie Carre, given the overall poor performance.

**2.	Enhance Marketing and Sales Strategies:**
-	Develop targeted marketing campaigns to promote veggie pizzas, emphasizing their value proposition and higher revenue contribution. We may introduce attractive bundle or combo deals for vegetarian pizzas to increase order sizes and sale volume.
-	Leverage weekend and mealtime sales trends by optimizing staffing, stock levels, and marketing efforts during peak periods.
-	Explore promotional activities and sales boosts to mitigate sales declines observed during specific weeks and months (e.g., week 39, September/October). On holiday periods (e.g., New Year, Christmas), it is suggested to offer festive promotions, such as bundled family meals or gifts like free drinks or holiday-themed desserts and toys with orders.

**3.	Refine Operational Efficiency:**
-	Dynamically adjust daily stock and preparation levels based on average daily sales and observed fluctuations in demand.
-	Analyze and optimize ingredient purchasing based on customer preferences highlighted in the ingredient analysis.
-	Consider implementing a system to better predict and manage the large variance in time between orders.
